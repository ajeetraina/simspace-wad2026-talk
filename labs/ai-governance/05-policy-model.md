*Authored once (UI or API), synced to the daemon at login, cached, and applied to
every sandbox. Each request is evaluated **deny → allow → default-deny**.*

You set your org and logged in during **Lab 1**, so org policy is already synced to
the local `sbx` daemon. Now the model behind what you'll enforce in the next sections.

## Where policies live

Policies for `$$org$$` live in one control plane, authored **two ways** - both
write to the same source of truth:

1. **Docker Hub Admin Console (UI)** - point and click at
   [app.docker.com/accounts/$$org$$](https://app.docker.com/accounts/$$org$$) →
   **AI governance**. Best for a human making a one-off change.
2. **Docker AI Governance API** - the same control plane over HTTP. Best for
   governance-as-code: version control, CI, admin tooling. (See the final section.)

Only org admins can modify policies. Developers **cannot override them locally**.
That's the point.

## How policies reach developers

When a developer runs `sbx login` (or `docker login`) with org credentials, the
client fetches the org's AI governance policies. The local `sbx` daemon caches
them and applies them to every sandbox on that machine. See what's active:

```bash
sbx policy ls
```

The `Governance: managed by $$org$$` header plus a sync timestamp is your proof
governance is live. To force an immediate refresh after an admin changes a policy:

```bash
sbx policy reset
```

## How rules evaluate

Rules are evaluated **per request** at the sandbox network proxy:

1. Does any **deny** rule match? → Block (403)
2. Does any **allow** rule match? → Forward
3. Otherwise → **Default-deny** (block)

This means:

- **Explicit deny always wins.** A deny for `paste.ee` blocks it even if a broader
  allow exists.
- **Default-deny** means you don't enumerate every bad destination. Not explicitly
  allowed = blocked.
- A `0.0.0.0/0` catch-all allow **defeats** this model - it permits everything.

## Local vs remote

```bash
sbx policy ls --include-inactive
```

| `ORIGIN` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `local` | Defaults shipped with sbx, or rules you added locally |
| `remote` | Pulled from your org's Admin Console - authoritative, un-overridable |

When the org sets a policy for a rule type, local rules of that type go
**inactive**: `corporate policy takes precedence`. The CISO has the wheel.

> [!NOTE]
> Network and filesystem rules flow from the admin. **Credential isolation** -
> keeping real API keys out of the sandbox - is a sandbox runtime protection you
> configure developer-side. It complements these policies (its own section later).

## Try it live - the policy switches

In the real product an admin flips these rules in the
[app.docker.com](https://app.docker.com) **AI governance** console. This lab gives
you the same switches: open **Settings** (the ⚙ gear, top-right, next to Reset) and
you'll find three toggles -

- **AI Governance - enforced by your org** (the master switch)
- **Network rule: deny exfiltration**
- **Filesystem rule: deny credentials**

They start **on**. Flip one **off**, then re-run the relevant command and watch
enforcement change - e.g. turn *AI Governance* off and run `sbx policy ls` (the
`managed by $$org$$` header disappears), or turn *deny exfiltration* off and re-run
the `paste.ee` curl in the **Network Enforcement** lab (it returns `200` instead of
`403`). Toggle them back on to restore the governed posture.

> [!TIP]
> The toggles are the fastest way to *feel* default-deny: with governance off,
> the very same commands that were blocked now sail through.

Now let's start containing the agent - beginning with **Credential Isolation**.
